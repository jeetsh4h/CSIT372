- Database
An organised collection of data stored and accessed electronically.
It is designed to hold structured data, and allows us to query and manipulate it.

- DBMS
(Database Management System)
A software system that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself.
It provides users with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.

- RDBMS
Relational DBMS stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.
This allows us to identify and access data in relation to other picces of data.
Data is organised into tables, each table has a key field that uniquely identifies each row.
Relations among tables are created through foreign keys.

- Database Engine
Ensures that the storage of data is efficient; in terms of read-write speed from a disk.
A database engine is the layer between the data and the DBMS.

- SQLite
It is a C-Language library that implements a SQL database engine.
It is also a file format (single file) which is cross-platform and backwards compatible.

- MySQL
It is a DBMS which can use multiple database engines.
It typically uses the client-server architecture.

- MySQL v/s sqlite
    - Similarities
        Both MySQL and SQLite are relational database management systems (RDBMS).
        They both support SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.
        Both can be used in client-server architecture, allowing multiple clients to access the database simultaneously.
        They both provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity.
        Both support indexes for efficient data retrieval.
    - Differences
        - MySQL
            MySQL is a client-server RDBMS.
            It supports multiple concurrent connections.
            It is suitable for large-scale applications with high traffic.
            It offers advanced features like replication, clustering, and partitioning.
            It requires a separate installation and configuration process.
        - SQLite
            SQLite is a serverless embedded RDBMS.
            It operates on a single file and does not require a separate server process.
            It is suitable for small-scale applications or mobile development.
            It has a smaller footprint and is easier to set up and use.
            It lacks advanced features like replication and clustering.

            parse = false;
        }
        else {
            std::cerr << "Invalid argument." << std::endl;
            return 1;
        }
    } else
    {
        ; // using default argument => parsing the line
    }


View #1
    File can be seen as a stream of bytes
    This the view that is taken into account when using C APIs

View #2
    File is a collection of records with fields
